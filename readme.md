<h1>Buck Shot Ruby 🔫</h1>

This is a recreation of [Barji's](https://www.youtube.com/c/BarjiGames) Buck Shot Game implemented in ruby with [ruby2d](https://www.ruby2d.com/).

## The game 🎮
Basically you have to survive by not falling out of the game window. To get up you have to use the recoil of the gun.
But you have to watch out because you have limited ammunition. If that is too easy for you you can change the difficulty
to make obstacles fall from the sky.

## Setting up the local development environment 🖥️
To continue developing on this project you need [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/de/) and the [ruby2d package](https://www.ruby2d.com/learn/get-started/)

## Downloading the requiered ressources 
To get ruby go their [download page](https://www.ruby-lang.org/de/downloads/)

For ruby2d you can use the ruby's Rubygem package manager, just enter the following command in your terminal
```shell
gem install ruby2d
```

That's it ✨

## Running the game in development mode
To run the game enter the following command in your terminal
```shell
